# Tom & Journey – Your Ultimate Travel Companion
Tom & Journey is a collaborative effort between Atibdee and me, resulting in a user-friendly travel planning website developed as part of our Software Developer coursework. Tailored for ease of use, this platform empowers users to effortlessly plan their trips with customizable filters for various points of interest. Once a route is selected, the site provides estimates for distance, time, and budget. Users can personalize their itineraries, zoom in/out on the map, and leverage OpenStreetMap's extensive data.

Our project also includes a thoughtfully designed admin panel, enabling seamless pin configuration with MongoDB integration for real-time database updates. Tom & Journey serves as a testament to our expertise in web development, database management, and user-centric design.
