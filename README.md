# 🌍 Tom & Journey – Your Ultimate Travel Companion ✨🚀
Tom & Journey is a collaborative effort between Atibdee and me, resulting in a user-friendly travel planning website developed as part of our Software Developer coursework. Tailored for ease of use, this platform empowers users to effortlessly plan their trips with customizable filters for various points of interest. Once a route is selected, the site provides estimates for distance, time, and budget. Users can personalize their itineraries, zoom in/out on the map, and leverage OpenStreetMap's extensive data.

Our project also includes a thoughtfully designed admin panel, enabling seamless pin configuration with MongoDB integration for real-time database updates. Tom & Journey serves as a testament to our expertise in web development, database management, and user-centric design.

| _Your trip planner will recommend a suitable trip for you, displaying the trip name, total distance, total travel time, and the number of places to visit. The time and distance are calculated using Leaflet and OpenStreetMap, open-source tools that provide an interactive map experience._ |

| _I've designed the trip planner page to include a map, map filters, pins, pin details, and automatic trip routing. You have the freedom to move the map as you wish, with the ability to zoom in and out. The filters consist of 10 categories, including points of interest for photography, hotels, gas stations, food establishments, metro/skytrain stations, museums, grocery stores, ports, cafes, and bars. Each filter can be toggled separately. The pins are added manually, and the routing system is provided by Leaflet._ |
